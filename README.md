# UFOs: Aliens, Bootscrap, & Javascript

Of the three, Anna found JavaScript to be more frightening in the beginning but by the end of this project, she felt empowered to continue her search for life beyond and advancing her coding skills. This updated webpage allows both Anna and those she's working with greater ease to review the large data set of UFO sightings by incorporting more filters that would allow for greater insights behind the initial date filter.

## Results

Based on the new table layout, a visitor to the webpage will be able to select what data they'd like to filter by based on the following options: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. A visitor has the option to choose one or more of these filters by simply entering in the text and pressing enter.

Now, the users can clearly see the differences in volumes based on their filters. In the example below, we can see that in California, only 2 UFO sightings were in the shape of a fireball. In comparison, triangles were 3x more likely to be the shape seen in Califorina UFO sightings.

## Summary

Overall, the updates to the table offered great improvement to the user experience and ease of gaining insights into UFO sightings, however there are opportunities for futher improvment. Dana should consider: 
 - Updating the table to allow for sorting by duration from longest to shortest, and vice versa
 - Including an filter that will allow you to search for "keywords" within the comments section
